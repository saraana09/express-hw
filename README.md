# First Express Homework

    Set up some express servers for practice
    make some get routes
    use url/query parameters
#Greetings routte

    Make a route '/greeting' that sends a generic greeting to the screen like "Hello, stranger".
    Give the greeting route a param /:name
    When hitting the route, the page should display a message such as "Hello, ", or "What's up, <name>", or "<name>! It's so great to see you!" 
    (ex. hitting '/greeting/Jimmy-boy' should display Wow! Hello there, Jimmy-boy on the page).
#Tip Calculator

    have a route of '/tip' and it should expect 2 params. One should be total and one should be tipPercentage.
    When hitting the route, the page should display how much your tip will be based on the total amount of the bill and the tip percentage. 
    (ex. hitting '/tip/100/20' should display 20 on the page).
# Magic 8 Ball

    If the user hits that route and asks a question of "Will I be a Millionaire" 
    he should get his question asked and a random Magic 8 ball quote on the screen.
    
#Take one Down and Pass it Around

    Build an express application that enables users to count down the number of bottles of beer.
